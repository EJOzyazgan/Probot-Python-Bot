# Probot-Python-Bot
Example Python bot for Probot Playground

This is a very simple python bot running with a Flask server.

It is highly recomended that you update the bot logic.

All needed python libraries (Flask) should already be set up in `web/venv`.
If they are not Flask can be installed using `pip install flask`

The Flask server may be run localy using `flask run`
